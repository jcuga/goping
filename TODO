TODO:
- load data from File
- ensure at least one address or exit with warning
- set up go on laptop
- add actual pinging with goroutines that use time.after() or whatever to get
  pings on a schedule.
   - have time.after spawn goroutines, so actual scheduling isnt slowed by
     pings.  TODO: add note about why using os/exec since ping uses sockets
     that generally require root but ping cmdline tool has linux setid to allow
     the priviledged behavior without root perms.
- build/run code, then port to linux vm, make sure args to ping are same
  - can cross compile for other OS--golang for the win!
